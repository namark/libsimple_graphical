# Intro
Running `make` here should produce an executable for each source file in a subdirectory called `out`.
Examples that make use of OpenGL are disabled by default to keep the dependencies to minimum. To enable run make with `ENABLE_OPENGL_EXAMPLES` parameter set:
```
make ENABLE_OPENGL_EXAMPLES=anything
```
